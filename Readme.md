## Implementaion Plan
- [x] Add binarize operation after softmax (3.2 LEARNING BINARIZED PATH)
- [x] Add two path select when gradient update (3.2.1 TRAINING BINARIZED ARCHITECTURE PARAMETERS)
- [ ] Add latency loss (3.3.1 MAKING LATENCY DIFFERENTIABLE)
- [x] Change search space (4.2 EXPERIMENTS ON IMAGENET)
- [x] Add MBConv operation (4.2 EXPERIMENTS ON IMAGENET)

- [ ] Change searched model training code
- [ ] Change searched model test code
